## abstract: 
The Face Mask Detection Project utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks. The project employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze images or video streams and classify detected faces as masked or unmasked. This project has applications in public health surveillance, security and access control, and smart retail and marketing.
